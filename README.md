# k8s-eks-clb
Machine Learning App hosted on EKS Cluster and exposed through a AWS Classic Load Balancer (CLB).
Using a Code Pipeline to manage the deployments into this cluster.

Will be covering AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) which is much more feature-rich compared to a CLB, in a subsequent repo.
